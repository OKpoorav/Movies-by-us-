- **Rating System**: 10-point rating scale with 5-star visual representation
- **Movie Details**: Title, poster image, ratings, and personal reviews
- **CRUD Operations**: Add, edit, and delete movies from collections
- **Responsive Design**: Modern UI with smooth animations and transitions
- **Cloud Storage**: Data persistence using Firebase Firestore
- **Offline Backup**: Fallback to localStorage when offline
- **Environment Variables**: Secure storage of Firebase configuration

```

### Backend Implementation

The application uses Firebase Firestore as its backend for data storage:

#### Firebase Integration
- **Firebase Setup**: Project configured in Firebase Console
- **Firestore Database**: NoSQL cloud database for movie data
- **Data Migration**: Automatic migration from localStorage to Firestore
- **Offline Support**: Fallback to localStorage when Firebase is unavailable
- **Environment Variables**: Firebase configuration stored securely in .env file

#### Firebase Operations
- **Read**: Fetches all movies from Firestore on application load
- **Create**: Adds new movies to both Firestore and local state
- **Update**: Updates existing movies in both Firestore and local state
- **Delete**: Removes movies from both Firestore and local state

### Key Components

#### firebase.js
- Configures Firebase with application credentials from environment variables
- Exports Firestore functions for database operations
- Provides a central access point for Firebase services
- Uses environment variables for secure configuration

#### MovieContext.js
- Provides global state management for movies
- Handles CRUD operations for movie data with Firebase
- Manages data synchronization between Firestore and local state
- Handles migration of existing data from localStorage to Firestore
- Provides filtering functions for different movie categories
- Includes loading state for UI feedback during Firebase operations

#### MovieCard.js
- Displays movie details in a card format
- Renders movie title, poster, ratings, and reviews
- Provides edit and delete options
- Uses star rating visualization
- Applies person-specific colors (his: navy blue, hers: lilac, ours: lavender)

#### AddMovieForm.js
- Form for adding new movies
- Dynamic input fields based on collection type
- 10-point rating system with interactive clickable number buttons
- Preview for poster images
- Responsive design with animations

#### EditMovieModal.js
- Modal interface for editing existing movies
- Pre-populated form with existing movie data
- Similar UI to AddMovieForm but in a modal context
- Click-outside functionality to dismiss
